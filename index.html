							<h1><font color="#840000">Program Overview</font></h1>
							<p><font color="#000000">The Directed Reading Program provides undergraduates with the opportunity to work one-on-one with graduate students in the Division of Applied Mathematics (APMA) on an independent reading project. It is a fantastic opportunity for motivated undergraduates to learn new mathematical & computational skills, forge connections with graduate students, and explore higher level mathematics outside of the undergraduate curriculum.</font></p>

							<p><font color="#000000">At the foundation of the Directed Reading Program is informality. We understand that the classroom environment can be limiting, while formal research projects for credit with APMA faculty might seem daunting, especially for students who have never worked on a research project before. The DRP allows students to explore and discuss new mathematical concepts in a stress-free, casual environment. It is ideally suited for motivated sophomores and juniors who are curious about higher level mathematics.</font></p>

							<!-- <p><font color="#000000">Participants in the DRP are paired individually with a graduate student mentor based on the participants' mathematical interests. Throughout the semester, students will independently work through a mathematical text or paper(s) and meet weekly with their mentors to discuss it. Many projects in the APMA DRP will also have significant implementation/programming components. The DRP culminates in an end-of-semester presentation in which participants give brief talks on their projects to the other mentees and mentors.</font></p> -->

							<h2><font color="#840000">Expectations for Undergraduates</font></h2>
							<p><font color="#000000">While the DRP provides an informal and individualized experience, there are some general expectations and responsibilities for participants. We expect participants to be committed to the DRP for the entire semester, so if you are currently taking a heavy courseload, please read the following expectations carefully:
							<ul>
								<li>Participants are expected to meet with their graduate student mentor for about one hour per week. These meetings are a valuable way in which students may discuss and clarify their understanding of the material. </li>
  								<li>Participants should expect to spend at least four hours per week on their projects, whether this entails reading, implementation, or both. It is important to note that the time outside of meetings should be spent reading and digesting new material, while meetings with mentors are reserved for discussion and clarification. Thus, it is important that participants come prepared for their meetings.</li>
  								<li>At the end of the semester, each participant will present their work to the other participants and mentors at a colloquium. This presentation should cover the main points of the project and is an excellent way for students to practice presenting complex mathematical material.</li>
							</ul><br/>

							<p><font color="#000000">Please note that the Directed Reading Program is offered every fall and spring semester, and we solicit applications at the beginning of each semester. Projects last for the duration of a semester and students wishing to partipicate again must submit another application. Applicants who have never participated in the DRP will be given preference.</font></p>

							<h1><font color="#840000">Frequently Asked Questions</font></h1>
							<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Q: How will I be paired with my mentor?</strong><br/>

								<strong>A:</strong> Mentees are asked to indicate which areas of applied mathematics are of interest to them on the application form. Similarly, graduate mentors list which areas they are interested in mentoring students in. We pair mentees and mentors based on these interests.
							</font></p>
							
							<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Q: How does the project selection process work?</strong><br/>

								<strong>A:</strong> Admitted students will decide their projects during the first few meetings with their mentors. The project selection is a mutual decision that balances the students's interests and their mentors's expertise. We want for participants to be able to do work that they are genuinely interested in, so we spend a lot of time making sure you are paired with a mentor with similar interests.
							</font></p>


							<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Q: Do I have to have experience in the subject I would like to do a project in?</strong><br/>

								<strong>A:</strong> Absolutely not! The DRP is intended to be a gentle introduction to higher level mathematics. However, applicants should have some coursework background in the general subject area they wish to work in. For example, students wishing to work on probability or machine learning projects should have already taken APMA 1650 or 1655, or have equivalent course credit from another institution. Similarly, students wishing to work in dynamical systems should have taken APMA 0350 or equivalent. 
							</font></p>

							<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Q: Are there any prerequisites to applying to the DRP?</strong><br/>

								<strong>A:</strong> There are no formal prerequisites for the DRP and we encourage students of all backgrounds to apply, even those who are not concentrating in Applied Mathematics. However, most projects will require knowledge from MATH 0090, MATH 0100, MATH 0180, MATH 0520, and APMA 0350/0360, which are typically taken during the first two years of the APMA curriculum. These are not rigid requirements and we recognize that different project areas will require different coursework. For example, APMA 0350/0360 may be less relevant to probability/statistics/machine learning projects than, say, APMA 1655. Motivated sophomores and juniors are especially encouraged to apply. 
							</font></p>

							<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Q: Can I receive course credit for participating in the DRP?</strong><br/>

								<strong>A:</strong> For the Fall 2018 semester, we are unable to provide course credit for participating in the DRP. We are currently looking into the possibility of providing course credit in future semesters. 
							</font></p>

							<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Q: How will my performance be assessed in the DRP?</strong><br/>

								<strong>A:</strong> There are no grades or formal assessments in the DRP. At its core, the DRP is an <i>independent</i> reading project that is driven first and foremost by the student. While we do expect a certain level of time commitment from participants, it is up to the student to set semester goals with their mentor. The end-of-semester presentation is primarily an opportunity for students to teach their peers what they have learned over the course of the semester. 
							</font></p>

							<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Q: How are applications assessed? What can I do to increase my chances of being accepted to the DRP?</strong><br/>

								<strong>A:</strong> There are two main components to the DRP application: (i) prior coursework and (ii) the statement of interest. We are mainly looking to see that applicants have completed enough coursework to succeed in the project areas they have listed on the application. For example, PDE projects will likely require knowledge from APMA 0360, dynamical systems projects from APMA 0350, probability/statistics/machine learning projects from APMA 1650, etc. We do <strong>not</strong> care about grades and do not ask for them.<br/><br/>

								<i>The statement of interest is arguably the most important component of the application.</i> We are genuinely interested in your motivations as an aspiring mathematician(/engineer/physicst) and what you would like to learn from the DRP. In particular, what personal factors have influenced your growth and decision to study mathematics?<br/>
							</font></p>

							<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Q: I was not offered a position in the DRP last semester. Can I apply again this semester?</strong><br/>

								<strong>A:</strong> Absolutely! Due to the highly personalized nature of the DRP, we receive many times more qualified applicants than we can accomodate. We recognize that there is a very large interest in the DRP and therefore offer the program every semester. We give preference to applicants who have never participated in the DRP before. 
							</font></p>

							<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Q: I see that the Department of Mathematics also offers a Directed Reading Program. What is the difference between the APMA DRP and MATH DRP?</strong><br/>

								<strong>A:</strong> The APMA DRP generally offers projects that are both theoretical and applied in nature - that is, students will study the mathematical foundations but also apply these concepts, typically in the form of a programming component to their projects. The MATH DRP has a purely theoretical focus in which the goal of the project is to work towards understanding the proof of a fundamental result in the field.<br/><br/>

								Generally speaking, there is little overlap in the fields of mathematics covered by the APMA and MATH DRPs, although it may happen occasionally, e.g. dynamical systems/ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations. The MATH DRP is run by the wondeful Ashley, Kyle, Jiahua, and Shamil. If you are interested in participating in the MATH DRP, please visit their <a style="color:#AE0000" href="https://www.math.brown.edu/~drp/">website</a>!
